</p>

A modular, node-based content generation engine designed to transform creative ideas into high-quality visual content including stickers, memes, and personalized greetings. Powered by **Alibaba Cloud AI** technologies for an intuitive visual workflow experience.

This application leverages **Alibaba Cloud Qwen** - an advanced language model by Alibaba Cloud - as the core AI engine for text generation, prompt enhancement, and intelligent content reasoning. Combined with Alibaba's image and video generation capabilities, ADIS AI delivers a comprehensive solution for creating culturally-relevant Indonesian content.

## Overview

ADIS AI provides a visual pipeline editor that enables users to create complex content generation workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The application leverages Alibaba Cloud AI services (Qwen for text/reasoning, Wan for image/video generation) to power the content generation capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Visual Node-Based Editor**: Create and manage content generation pipelines using an intuitive canvas interface
- **Typed Port System**: Connection validation ensures data compatibility between nodes with distinct port types (text, prompt, image, video, style, media)
- **Pipeline Execution Engine**: Client-orchestrated execution with server-side AI processing, featuring topology sorting and state management
- **Template Presets**: Quick-start workflows for common use cases including Ramadan Wishes, Holiday Memes, AI Pet, and Custom Avatar generation
- **Real-time Execution Feedback**: Live progress updates and logging during pipeline execution
- **Indonesian Cultural Context**: Specialized templates and content generation for Indonesian cultural events and celebrations

## Node Categories

The pipeline editor supports five distinct node categories:

| Category | Description | Color Code |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Input** | Data entry points (Text Prompt, Image Upload, Template Preset) | Green |
| **Transform** | Data manipulation nodes (Prompt Enhancer, Style Config, Image to Text, Translate Text) | Purple |
| **Generate** | AI-powered content creation (Image Generator, Video Generator, Background Remover, Inpainting) | Blue |
| **Compose** | Layout and composition tools (Text Overlay, Frame Border, Sticker Layer, Collage Layout) | Orange |
| **Output** | Final output nodes (Preview, Export) | Red |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- pnpm 8.x or higher
- Backend server running (see `apps/server`)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies (from monorepo root)
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

### Build

```bash
# Create production build
pnpm build

# Preview production build locally
pnpm preview
```

## Available Templates

| Template | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Ramadan Wishes** | Generate personalized Ramadan greeting cards | Eid al-Fitr and Ramadan celebrations |
| **Holiday Meme** | Create viral holiday-themed memes | Social media content for holidays |
| **AI Pet** | Generate stylized pet character images | Personal pet avatars and stickers |
| **Custom Avatar** | Create personalized character avatars | Profile pictures and digital identities |
| **Blank Canvas** | Start from scratch with an empty workflow | Custom pipeline creation |

## Architecture

### Execution Model

The application implements a client-orchestrated, server-executed architecture:

1. **Frontend Orchestrator**: Manages execution graph topology, state management, and execution ordering
2. **Server Executor**: Stateless AI processing endpoint that validates inputs and calls AI APIs
3. **Real-time Updates**: SSE-based progress updates during pipeline execution

### Port Type System

The port type system ensures data compatibility through a static compatibility matrix:

- `text`: Plain text data
- `prompt`: AI prompt data (enhanced text for generation)
- `image`: Image data with URL reference
- `video`: Video data with URL reference
- `style`: Style configuration (art style, color palette, mood)
- `media`: Generic media type (compatible with image and video)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The web application connects to the backend server. Ensure the following configuration:

```
API_BASE=http://localhost:3000
```

### Model Options

AI model configurations are defined in `src/components/canvas/config/modelOptions.ts` and can be customized based on available Alibaba Cloud Model Studio services.

## Alibaba Qwen Integration

### Overview

ADIS AI leverages Alibaba Cloud's Qwen language model family to power intelligent content generation workflows. Qwen provides state-of-the-art natural language understanding and generation capabilities optimized for multilingual contexts, including Indonesian language support.

### Qwen Capabilities

| Capability | Usage in ADIS AI |
|------------|------------------|
| **Text Generation** | Create original content, prompts, and narratives |
| **Prompt Enhancement** | Intelligently enhance user prompts for better generation quality |
| **Language Understanding** | Analyze and process user inputs with cultural context awareness |
| **Reasoning & Logic** | Support complex workflow logic and conditional content generation |
| **Multilingual Support** | Native support for Indonesian and English language processing |

### Integration Points

1. **Prompt Enhancement Node** - Uses Qwen to analyze and enhance user prompts with creativity and tone modulation
2. **Template Presets** - Qwen generates contextually relevant content for cultural templates (Ramadan, Holidays, etc.)
3. **Text Transformation** - Text translation, rewriting, and style transformation capabilities
4. **Style Analysis** - Intelligent analysis of style requirements and color palette suggestions

### Qwen Model Versions

The application supports multiple Qwen model variants for different use cases:

- **Qwen-Long** - For processing extended context and complex reasoning
- **Qwen-Turbo** - Optimized for speed and real-time applications
- **Qwen-Max** - Maximum quality and instruction-following capabilities

Configuration of the active model can be adjusted in the application settings to match performance and accuracy requirements.
